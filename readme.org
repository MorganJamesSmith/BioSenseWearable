#+title: BioSense21

A university project by Morgan Smith, Samuel Dewan, Tadhg
McDonald-Jensen, and Jason Nyentap.
* Description
A wearable device that would contain a suite of sensors intended to
produce enough information to detect illness before symptoms occur.
* Feature List
** User Interface (do we need one?)
- Vibration Motor (for what?)
- A button (for what?)
- Speaker (for what?)
** Necessary Sensors
- Accelerometer
- Heart rate sensor
- Body temperature sensor
- Ambient temperature sensor
- air quality (BME680)
- noise levels (cuz it's cheap)
** Possible Sensors
- Breath rate sensor (how?)
- Blood sugar monitor
- Blood pressure monitor
- Pulse oximeter/heart rate (MAX86141 + MAX32664)
- ECG (AD8232)
- UV exposure

Using the Oura Ring which is a wearable device that measures heart
rate, inter-beat interval and changes in dermal temperature and is
associated with a smartphone app.

For iOS users, we support: Fitbit devices, Garmin devices, Samsung Galaxy Watch, Apple Watch, Oura Ring.

For Android users, we support Fitbit devices.

References other studies that indicate that increased temperature due
to infection can cause a higher heart rate

Lack of sleep is correlated with an elevated heart rate.

Mentions they would have like to use detection of voice changes or
galvanic skin response to detect stress level to identify
non-infectious causes of elected heart rate.

Heart rate is higher when it's cold and lower when it's warm

Heart rate is higher when you're dehydrated

Core temperature decreases during sleep but skin temperature increases

Measurements taken during airline flights differ significantly from
normal measurements

Skin temperature increases from inflammation, and viral disease

Skin temperature increases a lot from Lyme disease

Heart rate increases noticeably when suffering
from Lyme disease or rhinovirus
