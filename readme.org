* University Project

A university project to be done by Morgan Smith, Samuel
Dewan, Tadhg McDonald-Jensen, and Jason Nyentap.

** Skills we want to build/exercise
- Embedded firmware development
- PCB/Hardware design
- RTOS


** The project: Yet Another Smartwatch (YAS)  (Name subject to change)
*** Description
A smart watch type device that would contain a small suite of sensors
intended to produce information for a user that could in theory help
to increase their quality of life or provide valuable information to a
health care provider. We have considered attempting to integrate a
number of sensors that are commercially available as ICs such as a
pulse oximeter/heart rate sensor, single lead ECG, air quality sensor
and temperature sensor. We would aim to use an ARM microcontroller
with integrated Bluetooth radio (such as the nRF52840) to communicate
with a simple smartphone or desktop application.

*** Possible Feature List (We can't do everything here, we'll have to prioritize)
- Accelerometer
- Heart rate monitor
- Breath rate monitor
- Blood sugar monitor
- Blood pressure monitor
- Body temperature monitor
- Pulse oximeter/heart rate (MAX86141 + MAX32664)
- ECG (AD8232)
- air quality (BME680)
- noise levels (maybe a normal microphone?)
- UV exposure (I think the Microsoft band had this)
- Use as a security key [[https://github.com/google/OpenSK][OpenSK]] (OpenSK is written for an nRF52 running
  the RIOT RTOS)
- Vibration Motor
- Speaker

*** Form factor
- Watch with large buttons (Final Fantasy Spirits Within Seiko Watch)
- LCD (Not touch, or at least usable without touch)
- USB-C Port
- Looks cool
