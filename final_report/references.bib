    abstract = {Author Summary A new wave of wearable sensors allows frequent and continuous measurements of body functions (physiology), including heart rate, skin temperature, blood oxygen levels, and physical activity. We investigated the ability of wearable sensors to follow physiological changes that occur over the course of a day, during illness and other activities. Data from these sensors revealed personalized differences in daily patterns of activities. Interestingly, we discovered striking changes in particular environments such as airline flights. Blood oxygen levels decreased during high-altitude flights, and this decrease was associated with fatigue. By combining sensor information with frequent medical measurements, we made two important health-related observations. First, wearable sensors were useful in identifying the onset of Lyme disease and inflammation. From this observation, we then developed a computational algorithm for personalized disease detection using such sensors. Second, we found that wearable sensors can reveal physiological differences between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant individuals, raising the possibility that these sensors could help detect risk for type 2 diabetes. Overall, these results indicate that the information provided by wearable sensors is physiologically meaningful and actionable. Wearable sensors are likely to play an important role in managing health.},

abstract = {Context: The allocation of scarce health care resources requires a knowledge of disease costs. Whereas many studies of a variety of diseases are available, few focus on job-related injuries and illnesses. This article provides estimates of the national costs of occupational injury and illness among civilians in the United States for 2007. Methods: This study provides estimates of both the incidence of fatal and nonfatal injuries and nonfatal illnesses and the prevalence of fatal diseases as well as both medical and indirect (productivity) costs. To generate the estimates, I combined primary and secondary data sources with parameters from the literature and model assumptions. My primary sources were injury, disease, employment, and inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as well as costs data from the National Council on Compensation Insurance and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. My secondary sources were the National Academy of Social Insurance, literature estimates of Attributable Fractions (AF) of diseases with occupational components, and national estimates for all health care costs. Critical model assumptions were applied to the underreporting of injuries, wage-replacement rates, and AFs. Total costs were calculated by multiplying the number of cases by the average cost per case. A sensitivity analysis tested for the effects of the most consequential assumptions. Numerous improvements over earlier studies included reliance on BLS data for government workers and ten specific cancer sites rather than only one broad cancer category. Findings: The number of fatal and nonfatal injuries in 2007 was estimated to be more than 5,600 and almost 8,559,000, respectively, at a cost of \$6 billion and \$186 billion. The number of fatal and nonfatal illnesses was estimated at more than 53,000 and nearly 427,000, respectively, with cost estimates of \$46 billion and \$12 billion. For injuries and diseases combined, medical cost estimates were \$67 billion (27\% of the total), and indirect costs were almost \$183 billion (73\%). Injuries comprised 77 percent of the total, and diseases accounted for 23 percent. The total estimated costs were approximately \$250 billion, compared with the inflation-adjusted cost of \$217 billion for 1992. Conclusions: The medical and indirect costs of occupational injuries and illnesses are sizable, at least as large as the cost of cancer. Workers’ compensation covers less than 25 percent of these costs, so all members of society share the burden. The contributions of job-related injuries and illnesses to the overall cost of medical care and ill health are greater than generally assumed.},

abstract={The aim of this review is to investigate barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings. Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54{\%}). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30{\%}), rehabilitation (7, 35{\%}), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20{\%}), falls (2, 10{\%}) and mental health (1, 5{\%}). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and `silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.},

abstract={A long-life, high-capacity, highly safe and wearable solid-state zinc ion battery was constructed using a novel gelatin and PAM based electrolyte. Flexible and safe batteries, coupled with high performance and low cost, constitute a radical advance in portable and wearable electronics, especially considering the fact that these flexible devices are likely to experience more mechanical impacts and potential damage than well-protected rigid batteries. However, flexible lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are vastly limited by their intrinsic safety and cost issues. Here we introduce an extremely safe and wearable solid-state zinc ion battery (ZIB) comprising a novel gelatin and PAM based hierarchical polymer electrolyte (HPE) and an $\alpha$-MnO 2 nanorod/carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode. Benefiting from the well-designed electrolyte and electrodes, the flexible solid-state ZIB delivers a high areal energy density and power density (6.18 mW h cm −2 and 148.2 mW cm −2 , respectively), high specific capacity (306 mA h g −1 ) and excellent cycling stability (97{\%} capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2772 mA g −1 ). More importantly, the solid-state ZIB offers a high wearability and an extreme safety performance over conventional flexible LIBs, and performs very well under various severe conditions, such as being greatly cut, bent, hammered, punctured, sewed, washed in water or even put on fire. In addition, flexible ZIBs were integrated in series to power a commercial smart watch, a wearable pulse sensor, and a smart insole, which has been achieved to the best of our knowledge for the first time. These results demonstrate the promising potential of ZIBs in many practical wearable applications and offer a new platform for flexible and wearable energy storage technologies. },

abstract={Drug monitoring plays crucial roles in doping control and precision medicine. It helps physicians tailor drug dosage for optimal benefits, track patients' compliance to prescriptions, and understand the complex pharmacokinetics of drugs. Conventional drug tests rely on invasive blood draws. While urine and sweat are attractive alternative biofluids, the state‐of‐the‐art methods require separate sample collection and processing steps and fail to provide real‐time information. Here, a wearable platform equipped with an electrochemical differential pulse voltammetry sensing module for drug monitoring is presented. A methylxanthine drug, caffeine, is selected to demonstrate the platform's functionalities. Sweat caffeine levels are monitored under various conditions, such as drug doses and measurement time after drug intake. Elevated sweat caffeine levels upon increasing dosage and confirmable caffeine physiological trends are observed. This work leverages a wearable sweat sensing platform toward noninvasive and continuous point‐of‐care drug monitoring and management.

As such, the human aspects are often neglected, which can decrease not only the acceptance levels for novel devices, but also their sustained engagement. To facilitate the consideration of human factors in the early design stage, we present and define a list of 20 human-centered design principles.

abstract={The design and development of wearable biosensor systems for health monitoring has garnered lots of attention in the scientific community and the industry during the last years. Mainly motivated by increasing healthcare costs and propelled by recent technological advances in miniature biosensing devices, smart textiles, microelectronics, and wireless communications, the continuous advance of wearable sensor-based systems will potentially transform the future of healthcare by enabling proactive personal health management and ubiquitous monitoring of a patient's health condition. These systems can comprise various types of small physiological sensors, transmission modules and processing capabilities, and can thus facilitate low-cost wearable unobtrusive solutions for continuous all-day and any-place health, mental and activity status monitoring.

The authors focus on the issues pertinent to software designers without delving into the lower level details of the hardware realization of mobile computers. They look at some promising approaches under investigation and also consider their limitations. The many issues to be dealt with stem from three essential properties of mobile computing: communication, mobility, and portability. Of course, special-purpose systems may avoid some design pressures by doing without certain desirable properties. For instance portability would be less of a concern for mobile computers installed in the dashboards of cars than with hand-held mobile computers.

abstract={Self-powered systems running on scavenged energy will be a key enabler for pervasive computing across the Internet of Things. The variability of input power in energy-harvesting systems limits the effectiveness of static optimizations aimed at maximizing the input-energy-to-computation ratio. We show that the resultant gap between available and exploitable energy is significant, and that energy storage optimizations alone do not significantly close the gap. We characterize these effects on a real, fabricated energy-harvesting system based on a nonvolatile processor. We introduce a unified energy-oriented approach to first optimize the number of backups, by more aggressively using the stored energy available when power failure occurs, and then optimize forward progress via improving the rate of input energy to computation via dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and self-learning techniques. We evaluate combining these schemes and show capture of up to 75.5{\%} of all input energy toward processor computation, an average of 1.54 {\texttimes} increase over the best static "Forward Progress" baseline system. Notably, our energy-optimizing policy combinations simultaneously improve both the rate of forward progress and the rate of backup events (by up to 60.7{\%} and 79.2{\%} for RF power, respectively, and up to 231.2{\%} and reduced to zero, respectively, for solar power). This contrasts with static frequency optimization approaches in which these two metrics are antagonistic.},

abstract={The emergence of textile-based wearable sensors as light-weight portable devices to monitor desired parameters, has recently gained much interest and has led to the development of flexible electronics on non-rigid substrates. The flexible biosensors may result in improved sports performance, to monitor the desired bodies for injuries, improved clinical diagnostics and monitor biological molecules and ions in biological fluids such as saliva, sweat. In addition, they could help users with different types of disorders such as blindness. In this context, new composite and nanomaterials have been found to be promising candidates to obtain improved performance of the textile based wearable devices and to optimize the structures for intimate contact with the skin for better functionality. This review aims to provide the most recent cutting-edge information on emergence, fabrication, materials, and applications of chemical and physical flexible and stretchable textile-based (bio)sensors. Besides this, we discusss the recent key innovations and applications of textile-based sensors in healthcare.},

abstract = {Wearable systems have emerged as a promising area in healthcare research for the management of cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation and coronary heart diseases, as well as neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and epilepsy. Traditionally, wearable sensors were used on the body surface. Recent advancements in flexible electronics, however, have opened up a new era for wearing sensors inside the human body non-invasively, a research direction subtly but distinctively different from the invasive implantable systems. This new concept is particularly useful for sensing information inside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract because sensors designed and supported by flexible optoelectronic technologies are capable of conforming well and adhering to the irregular surface wall of the GI tract. Compared to sensors with traditional invasive designs, which require pins to anchor them on the GI wall, the new concept allows sensors to be worn non-invasively on the GI wall for the early and prompt detection of bleeding as well as better diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux diseases. In summary, wearable sensory systems have huge potentials that are yet to be fully explored. It is anticipated that the advancements in this area will continue to transform how healthcare is delivered in the future.}

abstract={Wearable monitoring devices are an innovative way to measure heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), however, there is still debate about the validity of these wearables. This study aimed to validate the accuracy and predictive value of the Empatica E4 wristband against the VU University Ambulatory Monitoring System (VU-AMS) in a clinical population of traumatized adolescents in residential care. A sample of 345 recordings of both the Empatica E4 wristband and the VU-AMS was derived from a feasibility study that included fifteen participants. They wore both devices during two experimental testing and twelve intervention sessions. We used correlations, cross-correlations, Mann-Whitney tests, difference factors, Bland-Altman plots, and Limits of Agreement to evaluate differences in outcomes between devices. Significant correlations were found between Empatica E4 and VU-AMS recordings for HR, SDNN, RMSSD, and HF recordings. There was a significant difference between the devices for all parameters but HR, although effect sizes were small for SDNN, LF, and HF. For all parameters but RMSSD, testing outcomes of the two devices led to the same conclusions regarding significance. The Empatica E4 wristband provides a new opportunity to measure HRV in an unobtrusive way. Results of this study indicate the potential of the Empatica E4 as a practical and valid tool for research on HR and HRV under non-movement conditions. While more research needs to be conducted, this study could be considered as a first step to support the use of HRV recordings provided by wearables.},
