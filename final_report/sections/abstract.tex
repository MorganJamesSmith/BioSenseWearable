Early detection of illness could limit the spread of infection, save lives, and
save money.  One possible method of early detection is to continuously measure
someones physiological state.  Here we detail our creation of such a continuous
biometric measurement device.  The device is in the form factor of a watch and
contains sensors to measure skin temperature, ambient temperature, and motion.  
The hardware layout for pulse oximetry, and UV light was also completed and 
hardware assembled for pulse oximetry but the drivers were not completed on time.
The device is powered by lithium ion battery that is charged
through a USB port and lasts two days of normal operation.  Sensor data can be
obtained through the USB port or Bluetooth by using the appropriate companion
software.  The companion software can then produce graphs to display the output
of the sensors.  The focus of this solution is on the collection of biometrics
and making them available for analysis.  No attempt was made to perform medical
analysis or give clinical diagnosis from the collected biometrics.  Our
intention was to design an open system so that those applications could be
integrated with or built on top of the work we have done for this project.
