Early detection of illness could limit the spread of infection, save lives, and
save money.  One possible method of early detection is to continuously measure
someones physiological state.  Here we detail our creation of such a continuous
biometric measurement device.  The device is in the form factor of a watch and
contains sensors to measure skin temperature, ambient temperature, heart rate,
pulse oximetry, and motion.  The device is powered by lithium ion battery that
is charged through a USB port.  Sensor data can be obtained through the USB
port or Bluetooth by using the appropriate companion software.  The focus of
this solution is on the collection of biometrics and making them available for
analysis.  No attempt was made to perform medical analysis or give clinical
diagnosis from the collected biometrics.  Our intention was to design the
system so that those applications could be integrated with or built on top of
the work we have done for this project.
