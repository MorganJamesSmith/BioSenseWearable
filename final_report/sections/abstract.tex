Early detection of illness could limit the spread of infection, save lives, and
save money.  One possible method of early detection is to continuously measure
someones physiological state.  Here we detail our creation of such a continuous
biometric measurement device.  The device is in the form factor of a watch and
contains sensors to measure skin temperature, ambient temperature, motion, 
heart rate, pulse oximetry, and UV light. The software drivers for UV light,
heart rate and pulse oximetry were not completed in time so data is only
recorded from motion and temperature sensors. The PCB also supports an air
quality sensor which was never populated due to a lack of availability.
The device is powered by a lithium ion battery that is charged
through a USB port and lasts two days of normal operation.  
The total cost of the unit is \costofboard.  Sensor data can be
obtained through the USB port or Bluetooth by using the appropriate companion
software.  The companion software can then produce graphs to display the output
of the sensors.  The focus of this solution is on the collection of biometrics
and making them available for analysis.  No attempt was made to perform medical
analysis or give clinical diagnosis from the collected biometrics.  Our
intention was to design an open source system so that those applications could be
integrated with or built on top of the work we have done for this project.
